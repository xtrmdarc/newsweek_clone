# NewsWeek Clone

> This is the most actual newsweek page up to date clone, which I developed on my own using pure HTML and CSS combined with the bootstrap framework and a little bit of JS to make the header stick on the laptop view. I suggested to name it NewsWeek Clone. This project is responsive to latop, tablet and mobile resolutions.
